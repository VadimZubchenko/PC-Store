## Overview

Developed as a desktop application this an inventory management tool designed for a small brick-and-mortar computer store. The application is intended for internal use to support sales, inventory management, and financial tracking. It features a simple and straightforward graphical interface to facilitate ease of use.

## Technologies and Tools

### Scrum methodology

The project was executed using the Scrum methodology, enhanced by the Agilefant application. User stories and use cases were defined in Agilefant, which allowed us to monitor and manage the progress of the application and the working hours of the team. Out of the 30 user stories in Agilefant, we completed 28. Figure 1 presents the user stories in Agilefant.

### Model
The Model component includes classes such as `Asiakas.java`, `Henkilosto.java`, `Osa.java`, `Paketti.java`, `Product.java`, and others which handle the data and business logic.

### View
The View component consists of several Java files like `View.java`, `LoginView.java`, `Tab1.java`, `Tab2.java`, `Tab3.java`, `Tab4.java`, and others which define the user interface.

### Controller
The Controller is managed by `Controller.java` which handles the input, processes the data with the Model, and updates the View.

## Features
- **Inventory Tracking:** Monitor stock levels in real-time.
- **Product Management:** Add, update, and remove product details.
- **Stock Alerts:** Receive notifications when stock levels are low.
- **Reporting:** Generate reports on inventory status and sales.
- **User Management:** Manage different user roles and permissions.
- **Search and Filter:** Easily search and filter through products.

### User Interfaces

- **Sales Page:** Allows sales personnel to create orders from available parts and computer packages, fill in customer information, and adjust order quantities.
